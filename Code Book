Actions performed : Data preparation and the 5 steps required as per course project’s guidelines.

Description:
1) Dataset downloaded and extracted in the working directory as Coursera_Week4_Final.zip

2) Assign Data to variables:
Line 15:22
features (the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.), activites (List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes (labels)),
subject_test (contains test data of volunteer test subjects being observed), x_test, 
y_test (contains recorded features test data), 
subject_train (contains train data of volunteer subjects being observed), 
x_train (contains recorded features train data) and 
y_train (contains train data of activities’code labels)

3) Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set
x_train and x_test using rbind() function
y_train and y_test using rbind() function
subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
Subject, Y and X using cbind() function

4) Extract the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
Subsetting Merged_Data, selecting only columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement

5) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

6) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
A) code column in TidyData renamed into activities
B) All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
C) All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
D) All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
E) All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
F) All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
G) All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

7) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
FinalData created by summarizing Tidy data taking the means of each variable, each activity and each subject, after grouping by subject and activity
